## Education
* 2023.11 - 2027 &emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&nbsp; Ph.D., RWTH Aachen University, Germany
* 2021.09 - 2023.09 &emsp; M.Sc., École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland
* 2017.09 - 2021.07 &emsp; B.Sc., Peking University, China

## Research experience
* 2023.11 - : Doctoral researcher, Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion
  * I use solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study heterogenous catalytic processes. With the significant line-narrowing achieved with the advent of new fast magic-angle spinning (MAS) techniques, the engagement of various types of noncovalent interactions can be resolved and identified. 
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Dr. Thomas Wiegand](https://www.cec.mpg.de/en/research/research-groups/prof-dr-thomas-wiegand){:target="_blank"}

* 2023.02 - 2023.08: Master's project, ETH Zürich
  * The experiment time and hence the sensitivity and resolution of pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments are limited by fast decoherence of the electron. One way to extend this coherence life time is hyperfine decoupling. By analytically and numerically solving Liouville-von Neumann equation, I simulated the evolution of electron magnetization under hyperfine decoupling. 
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Dr. Gunnar Jeschke](https://epr.ethz.ch/){:target="_blank"}

* 2022.03 - 2023.02: Master's student, EPFL
  * Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) has the potential to increase the sensitivity of NMR by 600-fold, but it is limited only to 100 K at present. To conduct DNP experiments at high temperature requires new polarizing agents and new matrices. In this project, I investigated the viability of polymers as room-temperature DNP matrices.
