Welcome to my homepage!  

My name is Yufei Wu, and I'm a PhD student working at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion and RWTH Aachen University.  

A data-driven personal website
------
This website is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io){:target="_blank"} and hosted on GitHub pages. The template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/){:target="_blank"} and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have. 

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
