Welcome to my homepage!  

I'm a doctoral student working at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Energy Conversion and RWTH Aachen University. My research interest lies in developing experimental techniques in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and apply them to study catalytic processes.
