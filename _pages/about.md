My name
------
Written in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), my name Yufei Wu shall be pronunced as [jyfeiwu]. The only thing to notice is the "yu" in "Yufei", which is pronunced as the close front rounded vowel [y], same as the letter "ü" in German or "u" in French.  

My first name in Chinese has the meaning of "spaceship". My parents gave me this name when they saw the successful lauch of China's first prototype of manned spacecraft "Shenzhou 1" on Nov. 19th 1999, shortly after my birth. Witnessing the fast developing of China's space exploration (now with the space station "Tiangong", sample return from the Moon "Chang'e", and Mars exploration "Tianwen"), I have well carried on my parents' wish to embrace chanllenges and explore the unknown since then.  

My home
------
I was born in the city of [Baoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baoji){:target="_blank"} [pɑutɕi], Shaanxi province. Located near the very geometric center of China, this is a small city ("small" in China) surrounded by mountains with a major river flowing through in the middle. For foreign visitors the landscape is alike to that of Pittsburg, the US or Chur, Switzerland.  

For high school I moved 170 km east to [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an){:target="_blank"} [ɕiʔan], the capital city of my province. Being the capital city of several of the most important dynasties in ancient China including Han and Tang, this city is known interationally for its unique position in China's history and culture. This city is home to 6 UNESCO world cultural heritages, especially the [Terracotta Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army){:target="_blank"} and the starting node of the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road){:target="_blank"}. Surrounding the city center there is also a well preserved [city wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortifications_of_Xi%27an){:target="_blank"} that was built as early as in the 14th century.  


My leisure time
------
I watch football, baseball, formula 1, and a little bit of other sports (fencing for example). I have been a fan of the football club *Borussia Möchengladbach* since 2013 (but that's not the reason I came to Aachen for PhD!). Some of my favorite players include *Yann Sommer* (Inter Milan), *Granit Xhaka* (Leverkusen), *Jonas Hofmann* (Möchengladbach), *Ko Itakura* (Möchengladbach), *Lei Wu* (Shanghai Port), *Shohei Ohtani* (Los Angeles Angels), and *Guanyu Zhou* (Alfa Romeo F1).  

I enjoy J-POP and K-POP music, and I'm a fan of the Japanese idol group AKB48. More information can be found on my [personal page](https://ifeimi.github.io/){:target="_blank"}.  

Acknowledgement

My profile photo (bird flying in pink-blue sky) is a gift from my special friend Chuchu. The image of bird came from part of my name which has the meaning "flying" in Chinese. Surrounding of the bird is decorated by the elegant [*Fermi's golden rule*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%27s_golden_rule){:target="_blank"}. Not many scientific concepts get to call themselves "golden"!
