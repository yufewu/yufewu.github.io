My name
------
Written in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), my name "Yufei Wu" shall be pronunced as [yfeiwu]. For english speakers the only thing to notice is the "yu" in "Yufei", which is pronunced as the close front rounded vowel [y], same as the letter "ü" in German or "u" in French.  

My first name in Chinese has the meaning of "spaceship". My parents gave me this name when they saw the successful lauch of China's first prototype of manned spacecraft "Shenzhou 1" on Nov. 20th 1999, shortly after my birth. Witnessing the fast developing of China's space exploration (now with the space station "Tiangong", sample return from the Moon "Chang'e", and Mars exploration "Tianwen"), I have well carried my parents' wish on to embrace challenges and explore the unknown since then.  

My home
------
I was born in the city of [Baoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baoji){:target="_blank"} [pɑutɕi], Shaanxi province. Located near the exact geometric center of China, this is a small city ("small" in China) surrounded by mountains with a river flowing through the middle. For foreign visitors the landscape is similar to that in Chur, Switzerland.  

For high school I moved 170 km east to [Xi'an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an){:target="_blank"} [ɕiʔan], the capital city of my province. Being the capital city of several of the most important dynasties in ancient China including Han and Tang, this city is known internationally for its unique position in China's history and culture. This city is home to 6 UNESCO world cultural heritages, especially the [Terracotta Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terracotta_Army){:target="_blank"} and the starting node of the [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road){:target="_blank"}. Surrounding the city center there is also a well preserved [city wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortifications_of_Xi%27an){:target="_blank"} which was built as early as in the 14th century.
